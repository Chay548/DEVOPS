            <div class="holy"> For the majority of Christian denominations, the Holy Spirit, or Holy Ghost, is believed to be the third Person of the Trinity,[1] a triune God manifested as God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, each being God.[2][3][4] Nontrinitarian Christians, who reject the doctrine of the Trinity, differ significantly from mainstream Christianity in their beliefs about the Holy Spirit. In Christian theology, pneumatology is the study of the Holy Spirit. </div>

                Who was Jehovah in the Bible? "Jehovah" is the proper name of the God of Israel in the Hebrew Bible and one of the seven names of God in Judaism. It was familiarized in the English-speaking world by William Tyndale and other settler English Protestant renditions of scripture such as the Geneva Bible and the King James Version. It is still used in some translations but not included in a lot of English translations, as the names "Lord" or "LORD" are used alternatively.
